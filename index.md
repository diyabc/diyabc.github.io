# DIYABC-RF

`DIYABC-RF` [1] is an inference software implementing 
*Approximate Bayesian Computation* (ABC) combined with 
supervised machine learning based on *Random Forests* (RF), 
for **model choice** and **parameter inference** in the context of 
population genetics analysis.

> :warning: **If you are looking for the previous DIYABC V2.1**: please check [here](/old), however we are not supporting this version anymore.


## Graphical User Interface

`DIYABC-RF` can be used through a graphical user interface (GUI) called 
`DIYABC-RF GUI`, please visit the [dedicated page](/gui/) for more 
information (and especially **installation instructions**).

`DIYABC-RF GUI` is a simple and user friendly interface for the `DIYABC-RF` 
framework.

The complete interface documentation is available on the 
[dedicated page](/doc/).

> :warning: If you encounter any issue, please visit and report bug at [DIYABC-RF GUI issue tracker](https://github.com/diyabc/diyabcGUI/issues).


## Command line tools

For advanced users, it is possible to use `DIYABC-RF` as a command-line 
pipeline based on the command-line softwares `diyabc` (https://github.com/diyabc/diyabc) 
and `abcranger` (https://github.com/diyabc/abcranger).

Please visit the [dedicated page](/cli/) for more details.
