# DIYABC-RF

`DIYABC-RF` [1] is an inference software implementing 
*Approximate Bayesian Computation* (ABC) combined with 
supervised machine learning based on *Random Forests* (RF), 
for **model choice** and **parameter inference** in the context of 
population genetics analysis.

> :warning: **If you are looking for the previous DIYABC V2.1**: please check [here](/old), however we are not maintaining this version anymore.

## Documentation

The complete software **documentation** for the _graphical user interface_ (GUI) and the _command line interface_ (CLI) is available on the [dedicated page](/doc/).

## Graphical User Interface

`DIYABC-RF` can be used through a graphical user interface (GUI) called `DIYABC-RF GUI`, please visit the [dedicated page](/gui/) for more 
information (and especially **installation instructions**).

`DIYABC-RF GUI` is a simple and user friendly interface for the `DIYABC-RF` 
framework.

> ⚠️ **Due to work overload, the development, support and maintenance for the project `DIYABC-RF GUI` is currently paused. Feel free to contact us (by submitting an issue) if you want to take over the development for this project. Pull request are also welcome to fix bug or implement missing functionalities. You can still use the command line version of the software which is still maintained/supported. Check the documentation page [here](/cli/). Thanks** ⚠️

> ℹ️ If you encounter any issue, please visit and report bug at [DIYABC-RF GUI issue tracker](https://github.com/diyabc/diyabcGUI/issues).

## Command line interface

For advanced users, it is possible to use `DIYABC-RF` as a command-line 
pipeline based on the command-line software [diyabc](https://github.com/diyabc/diyabc) 
and [abcranger](https://github.com/diyabc/abcranger).

Please visit the [dedicated page](/cli/) for more details.
