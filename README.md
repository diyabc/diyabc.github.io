# Graphical User Interface for DIYABC-RF software

### !! **IMPORTANT**: an important release is due before the end of June 2021 (the planning is now fixed, after several delays). It will fix numerous ongoing issues. Please wait for this new release before opening new issues. It was previously planned for May 12th, and we are really sorry for the delay, the final development stage did not go as smoothly as we expected !!

> **Disclaimer:** `DIYABC-RF GUI` is under final development stage and not officially released yet. You may still encounter a few bugs.

We provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for the `DIYABC-RF` software [1], called `DIYABC-RF GUI`.

> **Note:** `DIYABC-RF GUI` replaces the old interface [`DIYABC V2.1`](https://diyabc.github.io/old/) which is not maintained anymore.

Please check the project [website](https://diyabc.github.io/) for additional information and detailed documentation.

## Availability

`DIYABC-RF GUI` is available as a standalone application, or as a `shiny` web app implemented in the `diyabcGUI` R package .

You can either install and run the standalone app, or install the `diyabcGUI` R package and run `DIYABC-RF GUI` as a standard `shiny` app, c.f. [below](#r-package-installation).

`DIYABC-RF GUI` provides a set of tools implementing *Approximate Bayesian Computation* (ABC) combined with supervised machine learning based on *Random Forests* (RF), for **model choice** and **parameter inference** in the context of **population genetics** analysis.

`DIYABC-RF GUI` (and the package `diyabcGUI`) is a user-friendly interface for command-line softwares [diyabc](https://github.com/diyabc/diyabc) and [abcranger](<https://github.com/diyabc/abcranger>), which are elementary bricks of the `DIYABC-RF` pipeline.

## Authorship and licensing

The DIYABC-RF GUI software is edited by the DIYABC-RF Core team.

The Windows DIYABC-RF GUI standalone app is based on DesktopDeployR by Wyming Lee Pang (https://github.com/wleepang/DesktopDeployR).

## Installation

### Requirements

- `zip` program

### Standalone app

For Windows users:

1. Please download the latest release of `DIYABC-RF GUI` at <https://github.com/diyabc/diyabcGUI/releases/latest> and unzip `DIYABC-RF_GUI_<latest_version>.zip`

2. To launch `DIYABC-RF GUI`, run `DIYABC-RF_GUI.bat` in the previously extracted directory (either by double-clicking it or in a terminal, you can also create a shortcut to run it by right-clicking on it).

3. It will open a new tab in your web browser and you can use `DIYABC-RF GUI` as a web app.

**Important**: you should not forget to quit the app when you are done with the dedicated button (otherwise some background related processes will remains active). Repeat steps 2 and 3 to launch again the application.

> A log file for DIYABC-RF GUI is available in your user-specific directory for temporary files, generally `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\DIYABC-RF_GUI_<timestamp>.log`.

If you want to open multiple DIYABC-RF projects, you need to simultaneously open multiple instances of DIYABC-RF GUI (i.e. step 2 and 3).

At the moment, the standalone app is not available for Linux and MacOS users. Nonetheless, Linux and MacOS users can install the `diyabcGUI` package, c.f. [below](#r-package-installation), and 
run the DIYABC-RF GUI as a standard `shiny` app.

> **Note:** if encountering instability in the standalone app, we recommend to install and use the `shiny` app available in the `diyabcGUI` R package, c.f. [below](#r-package-installation).


### R package installation

1. Install `devtools` package (if not installed on your system)
```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

> **Note:** if you encounter any issue when installing `devtools`, please check the [next section](#potential-issue-with-devtools).

2. Install `diyabcGUI` package
```R
devtools::install_github(
    "diyabc/diyabcGUI",
    subdir = "R-pkg"
)
```

3. **The first time after installation**, you need to download required binary files (e.g. `diyabc` and `abcranger` command line tools) by running
```R
library(diyabcGUI)
diyabcGUI::dl_all_latest_bin()
```

> **Note:** you can run this command from time to time to update the required binary files in case new versions were released.

4. Launch the interface
```R
library(diyabcGUI)
diyabcGUI::diyabc()
```

The function `diyabc()` will launch DIYABC-RF GUI as a standard `shiny` web app, that you will be able to use either in your web browser or in the Rstudio `shiny` app viewer.

To run simultaneously mutliple instances of DIYABC-RF GUI, e.g. to simultaneously manage and run multiple projects, you just need to run several times the function `diyabc()` from R (this is not possible from RStudio).

### Potential issue with devtools

You may encounter some issue when installing devtools, please check the official 
[devtools page](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools).

Following `devtools` recommandations, make sure you have a working development environment.

- Windows: Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
- Mac: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.
- Linux: Install a compiler and various development libraries (details vary across different flavors of Linux).

For Ubuntu users [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-packages-using-devtools-on-ubuntu-18-04) is a guide to install devtools requirement (users of other Linux distributions may still find it useful).

### Shiny server installation

As a `shiny` app, DIYABC-RF GUI can be installed and run from a Shiny server. To do so, you just need (on Unix system, please adapt for Windows server) to:

1. install the `diyabcGUI` package on your system, c.f. [above](#r-package-installation)
2. manage the file access rights so that the Shiny server has access to the R package installation directory
3. Create a symbolic link to the directory given by the R command `system.file("application", package = "diyabcGUI")` inside the `site_dir` folder configured in `/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf` (by default `/srv/shiny-server`), e.g.:
```bash
ln -s /path/to/R_LIBS/diyabcGUI/application /srv/shiny-server/diyabc
```
4. DIYABC-RF GUI is now available on your server at `https://my.shiny.server.address/diyabc`
